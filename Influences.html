        </h1>
        <p>Salvador Dali was very skilled, and best known for his eye-capturing images that were both bizarre and inspiring.
            <br>He will always have an unforgettable influence on art, dating back from the 1900s to art that is seen in the modern day.
            <br>Unfortunately, his reputation was stained with the idea from other surrealists from his time that claimed he had an excessive love for money instead of recognizing Dali genius creativity and new approach to Surrealism art.
            <br>We need to go beyond this distinction between the good and the bad and show how the experimental Dali was extraordinarily important in the history of art and the artistic models from the 60s and 70s. (Houser, 2012), says Michel Bouhours,
            curator of the Pompidou Center in Paris.

            <br><br><br>Dali inspired creativity in others in more ways than one. His individuality and urge to differ from the rest were inspiring and caused a ripple effect to people then and even people now.
            <br>He strongly believed that the opinions of others do not define oneself, and that only you can judge yourself.
            <br>For his end-of-year oral exam for art history at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid led to his expulsion without a diploma.
            <br>He said, I am infinitely more intelligent than these three professors, and I therefore refuse to be examined by them.
            <br>What most instills creativity in others is his courage to be himself. He knew that he was good at what he did, and he would not let someone tell him otherwise, or what needed to be changed.
            <br>Despite not welcome at the academy and being turned away by other surrealists, he did not give up because he valued his self worth more than acceptance.
