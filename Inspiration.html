        <p>
            Dali and his paintings are considered <b>eccentric, thought-provoking and enigmatic</b> all of which could be highly compared to a grand- scaled, special and colorful puzzle.
            <br><br> Here are some of the puzzle pieces:
            <br><br><b>
                His own late brother
                </b>
            <br>His own given name was sadly not an ordinary one but of his own deceased older brother, who passed away just after learning to take his few first steps. This name gave a spark of rage in Dali mentality at a young age and later form his
            desire to be seen as THE ONE AND ONLY Salvador Dali.

            <b>The coming of age years in Madrid </b>
            <br> He attended the back then infamous school of art and sculpture De San Fernanado and was soon later suspended in 1923 for disobedience and disruption and was later expelled in 1926. It was during this 3 year period that he was able to
            network his way through his peers and seniors in the art world. <br><br>

            <br><b> The influential people</b>
            <br>
            <br><b>Luis Bunuel:</b><br>One of the individuals whom Dali though of as a like minded friend. It was the faithful idea pitch, the one that gave birth to an imaginable moving picture short of the time : Un Chien Andalou (‘An Andalusian Dog’)
            a cryptic and gruesome with a lot of unprecedented ideas with no lines at all. His time spent with Bunueal helped largely in Dali exploration of his creative style.
            <br>
            <img style="  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="inspiration_3.jpg" alt="childhood">
            <br><b>Gala</b>: She was his other half, his muse, his business partner and even caretaker for the most of their relationship. Often time he would imply her in many of his painting, which further aggravated the controversy in paintings like
            The Sacrament of the Last Supper where Dali portrayed Christ with features of Gala, she was his manager almost as she handled most of his clients and financial plan, his career took off mostly because of her devotion to it. However, Dali was
            under a lot of money pressure from her as well, she would often rushed him to work for commission and less art value was being shown as a result, this even formed the rift between him and the Surrealists.
