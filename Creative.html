        <h1>Creative Process </h1>
        <p>
            <br>Salvador Dali used several techniques that helped him become creative.<br><br> His most popular being a self-induced paranoid state. <br>He would stimulate paranoia to create irrational associations between objects and then paint the hallucinatory
            images. He would hold a spoon over a tin plate until he fell asleep, then would start to draw as soon as the spoon hit the plate. <br> To become semi-lucid, he would stand on his head until he almost passed out. <br> Drinking a cocktail mixture
            of absinthe and eggs on a regular basis. <br>Absinthe having hallucinatory properties would often give him inspirations for his surrealistic paintings.<br> There was speculation that he indulged in LSD, however his cryptic responses to whoever
            asked, never determined the truth <b> I do not take drugs I AM drug. DO NOT take LSD take Dali </b>
