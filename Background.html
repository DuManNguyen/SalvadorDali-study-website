        <h1>Who is Dali?</h1>
        <p><b>Background</b><br>Born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres, Spain, Salvador was encouraged to practice art from an early age.

            <br><br><br>
            <br><b>Family</b><br>Salvador grew up with his mother, father and younger sister. His mother’s name was Felipa Domenech Ferres and she stayed at home to raise the family. His mother had a kind parenting style and encouraged Salvador’s art
            and eccentric personality. His father’s name was Salvador Dali y Cusi and he worked as a middle-class lawyer and notary. He had a strict and disciplinary approach to parenting which often lead to arguments between him and his son. <br> Salvador
            had a younger sister named Ana Maria as well as an older brother who died soon after he was born due to gastroenteritis. His mother died when he was 16 and his father remarried her sister. Salvador and his father ’s relationship grew worse.
            His father was a bully.<br>

            <br><b>Growing Up</b> <br> Salvador Dali was advanced and intelligent as a young child. <br>He was prone to anger outbursts and because of these, he was bullied by his classmates that did not tolerate his attitude. He often got into arguments
            with his teachers as well. His parents built him an art studio where he practiced his skills.<br> Upon seeing the sophisticated work he produced his parents sent him to a drawing school at the Colegio de Hermanos Maristas and the Instituto
            in Figueres, Spain. A year later he discovered modern painting in Cadaques and soon later held his first public exhibition at the Municipal Theatre of Figueres. A few years later he attended Academia de San Fernando in Madrid but got suspended
            for reprimanding his professors and supposedly starting a riot among students. During this time he was also arrested under false allegations for supporting the Separatist movement. When he returned to school he claimed no professor was smart
            enough to grade his work which got him expelled.

            <b>Art</b><br>Between 1926-1929 Salvador often went to Paris where he befriended many artists including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró. During this time he starting working with Impressionism, Futurism and Cubism styles of art. <br>His paintings
            became known with three themes: man universe and sensations, sexual symbolism and ideographic imagery. In 1929, Salvador met his wife Elena Dmitrievna Diakonova, also known as Gala, who became his muse. She helped him with the legal side of
            his art by dealing with financial matters, contracts, and exhibition promotors. By 1930, Salvador Dalí had become a notorious figure of the Surrealist movement.
            <br>
            <b>Death</b> <br> Salvador Dali passed away on January 23rd, 1989 in his birth town of Figueres, Spain due to heart failure.
