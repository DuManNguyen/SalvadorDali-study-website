        <h1>Why he is still relevant today?</h1>
        <p><br><br>Salvador Dali is known to be a famous painter, one of his most known
            <br><br><b>The persistence of memory</b>. He became notorious for his colorful personality, and characteristic flamboyant style. For many years Dali was part of the Surrealistn movement.
            <br> <img style="  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="Today_1.jpg" alt=" Growing up">
            <br> His contribution to the movement was something called <b>paranoiac-critical method</b>, it was an exercise to access the subconscious to enhance artistic creativity. He would use this to create a reality from his dreams. This gave him
            the ability to mentally change reality to what he wanted, for him this became a way of life.
            <br><br>During his time Salvador Dali was working with styles of <b>impressionism, futurism and cubism</b>. His paintings became associated with 3 themes:
            <br> + Man universe and sensations
            <br>+ Sexual symbolism
            <br> + Ideographic imagery
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="Today_2.jpg" alt=" Growing up ">
                    </td>
                    <td><img src="Today_2B.jpg" alt=" Growing up "></td>
                    <td><img src="Today_2C.jpg" alt=" Growing up "></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br><br> His use of strange hallucinatory characters was influenced by Renaissance and contradicted the unreal dream. Dali went through a period he called the nuclear mysticism in which he created 19 large canvases. His artwork had taken on
            a technical brilliance that would combine detail with imagination using images, geometry and religious themes. In 1074 The Teatro- Museo opened where it featured the largest Surrealist structure, it contained a series of spaces that formed
            a single artistic object. His creativity and originality in his work is what made him known and is why it was a huge impact on society and the reason he is known today.<br>
